# Python-Projects
These are small, probably not that big scripts I will use to try and learn python.

# Stuff I want to do:
1. Automate
1. Not be afraid to learn new stuff
1. Think out side the box.

# Expectation
Don't expect anything much me learning python will definitely not be a big thing. Maybe I will create something special that's more general for others and not just something stupid for me that I feel I need.
