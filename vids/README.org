* Dependencies
In order to run this script you need:
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)][Python]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requests_(software)][Python Requests]]

** Software
Recommended:
- [[https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv][mpv]]
- [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]] or [[https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl][youtube-dl]]

The script takes a search term as input and returns a list of URLs of which one can be selected and opened in a program in your system's $PATH. [[https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv][mpv]] with [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]] or [[https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl][youtube-dl]] are recommend because [[https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv][mpv]] is minimal, not a browser and works well on lower end hardware. If you don't have or want [[https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv][mpv]], this script can be easily modified to open links in a browser or other program.

* Variables you can Configure
There are several variables at the top of the script for adjusting its behavior.
- =command= = "Browser/video player (include space at the end) "
- =librarian_instance= = "Librarian instance"
- =invidious_instance= = "Invidious instance"
- =piped_instance= = "Piped instance"
- =pipedapi_instance= = "Piped API instance"

** Thumbnails
This script will eventually display the thumbnail of each video link but this feature is still under development so it is set to False by default.
- =open_thumbs= = False
- =image_viewer= = "mspaint "
- =temp_dir= = "C:\\Users\\zoomer\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\thumbnail"

* How to run the script in your terminal
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# You will be prompted to input a search term
python vids.py <arg>

# You can also append the search term to the command
python vids.py <arg> "search"
#+END_SRC

** LBRY network
=-l= for lighthouse API (searching) & librarian api (comments)

* Help is appreciated!
I am not a great programmer yet so bug reports, suggestions for the inclusion of new video platforms/APIs, and code contributions are more than welcome!

Because I know many of this script's users are running UNIX-based operating systems while I am developing it on Microsoft Windows, I'll do my best to make sure everything functions on both systems. Please file a report or make a contribution if there are discrepancies in this area.

* TODO list:
- [ ] Add thumbnail support
- [ ] Save a history of watched videos
- [ ] Make a proper config file *NOT JSON*!
