* Python-Projects
These are small, probably not that big scripts I will use to try and learn python.

* Stuff I want to do:
- Automate
- Not be afraid to learn new stuff
- Think out side the box.

* Expectation
Don't expect anything much me learning python will definitely not be a big thing. Maybe I will create something special that's more general for others and not just something stupid for me that I feel I need.

* Projects so far
- Thumbnail creator (Not working that well)
- rssgenerator (Working)
- noodysee (Working)
