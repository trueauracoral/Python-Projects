#+TITLE: Mirror to github (maybe good)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git remote set-url --add --push origin "Some-Github-URL"
#+END_SRC

So this will replace your current push url with that new one you want to push to github in this case. In order to fix this you need to run the same command but with your previous push url (not github).


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git remote set-url --add --push origin "Some-normal-not-microsoft-spyware-Github-URL"
#+END_SRC


WOW now everytime you push it will go to github and to your previous thing. Hooray.
